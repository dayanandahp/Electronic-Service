## Installation and Setup (Electronic Services Project)

This guide outlines the steps to set up and run your local development environment for the Electronic Services project.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Steps:**

1. **Download Electronic Services Project:**
   Obtain the project files by cloning this repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/electronic-services.git](https://github.com/your-username/electronic-services.git)
Use code with caution.
Navigate to Project Directory:
Change your terminal directory to the newly cloned project folder:

Bash
cd electronic-services
Use code with caution.
Install Dependencies:
Install all required Python packages using pip:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Run the Project:
Execute the following command in your terminal to start the development server:

Bash
python manage.py runserver
Use code with caution.
This will typically start the server on http://localhost:8000/ (the default port may vary). You might need to adjust this based on your project configuration.

Open Application in Browser:
Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000/). You should now see the application running.

Using an IDE (Optional):

If you prefer using an IDE, open the project directory in your chosen IDE (e.g., code . for Visual Studio Code).
IDEs often offer features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging, making development more efficient.
